HTML tags are keywords that tell a web browser how to format and display a web page. They contain instructions on how to display an on-page element.
For example, the <p> tag is followed by the paragraph text, and the closing </p> tag.
When a web browser reads an HTML document, the browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tag has different properties. An HTML file must have some essential tags so that the web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.
An HTML element is a part of an HTML document that can contain formatting instructions, semantic meaning, and content. HTML elements are defined by a starting tag and, if the element contains other content, a closing tag. For example, the starting tag for a paragraph is <p> and the closing tag is </p>. The paragraph element is <p>This is paragraph</p>.
