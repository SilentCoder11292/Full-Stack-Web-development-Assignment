    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>
        Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a wide range of tasks, including web design, web programming, and database management. Web developers use a variety of programming languages and technologies to create websites that are both functional and visually appealing.
There are two main types of web developers: front-end developers and back-end developers. Front-end developers are responsible for the part of a website that users see and interact with. This includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up a website's user interface. Back-end developers are responsible for the server-side of a website, which is the part that users cannot see or interact with. This includes the PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Java that power a website's functionality.
