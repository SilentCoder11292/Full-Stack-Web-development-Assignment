Question : What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Answer: 

Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
These statements allow you to execute certain parts of your code only if a specified condition is true, or to execute alternative code if the condition is false.

The primary conditional statements in JavaScript are:

1.if statement
2.if...else statement
3.if...else if...else statement
4.switch statement

1. if Statement
The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

Example:
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
}

2. if...else Statement
The if...else statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
 
Example:

 let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
    console.log("You are not an adult.");
}

3. if...else if...else Statement
The if...else if...else statement is used to specify a new condition if the first condition is false. You can have multiple else if blocks to handle various conditions.

Syntax:

if (condition1) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // block of code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}


Example:

let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
    console.log("Grade: F");
}


4. switch Statement
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
It is often used as an alternative to multiple if...else if statements when you need to compare the same expression to different values.

Syntax:

switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // block of code to be executed if expression === value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // block of code to be executed if expression === value2
        break;
    // more cases...
    default:
        // block of code to be executed if none of the cases match
}


Example:

let day = "Tuesday";

switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("Today is Monday.");
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        console.log("Today is Tuesday.");
        break;
    case "Wednesday":
        console.log("Today is Wednesday.");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Not a valid day.");
}
