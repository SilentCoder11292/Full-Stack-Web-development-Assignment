Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.
Answer: 

Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, either a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met. 
They are essential for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures (such as arrays or objects), and simplifying code that would otherwise require multiple similar statements.

JavaScript provides several types of loops:

1.for loop
2.while loop
3.do...while loop
4.for...in loop
5.for...of loop

1. for Loop
The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code block to be executed
}


Example: 

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
}


2. while Loop
The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known before entering the loop.

Syntax:

while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}

Example: 

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
    i++;
}

3. do...while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it will always execute the code block at least once before checking the condition.

Syntax:

do {
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);


Example:

let i = 0;
do {
    console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);

4. for...in Loop
The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It can also be used to iterate over the indices of an array.

Syntax:

for (variable in object) {
    // code block to be executed
}

Example:

const person = {name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York"};

for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}


5. for...of Loop
The for...of loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object (such as an array, string, or a Map).

Syntax:

for (variable of iterable) {
    // code block to be executed
}


Example:

const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

for (let color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}
