Question 5:Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.
Answer:
Comments in JavaScript are essential for code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.
They serve several important purposes:

1.Documentation: Comments provide explanations and context about the code's purpose, logic, and
functionality. This makes it easier for other developers (or your future self) to understand and work with the
code.

2.Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "Comment out " code during debugging, helping you isolate issue 
without deleting code.

3.Communication: Comments allow develop:rs to communicate with each oth:r, explaining why certain
decisions were made or describing how specific code segments work.

4.Organization: Comments can be used to divide code into logical sections, making it easier to navigate and
maintain larger codebase.

5.Legal And Compliance: In some cases, comm:nts may be required to explain licensing, copyright
information, or compliance with regulations.
