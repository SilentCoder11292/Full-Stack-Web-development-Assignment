Question 2 - Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.
Answer - 

#JavaScript

1.JavaScript is a high-level programming language used for adding interactivity
and functionality to web pages.

2.JavaScript allows you to create dynamic elements and behaviors on a webpage. For
example, you can validate form inputs, create animations, or update content in real-time based on user
actions.

3.JavaScript includes variables, data types, and control structures like loops and
conditionals, enabling you to create complex logic and algorithms.

4.JavaScript runs in web browsers, making it a client-side technology. It executes on the user's
device, enabling real-time user interactions.

#HTML

1.HTML is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on web pages.

2.HTML defines the static structure of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
and images.

3.HTML uses tags (e.g., <div>, <p>, <a>) to create elements that structure the content and
provide semantic meaning.

4.HTML's primary role is to define the content's structure and semantics, which browsers
render as a web page.
